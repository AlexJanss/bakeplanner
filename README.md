<h1>Bakeplaner App</h1>

The goal is to create a bake planer, predominately for bread recipes. This planer will calculate the time each step of a recipe has to be done.
There should be a recipe database, where users can add recipes. An user registration is planed as well. 
The framework I will be using for this web app is Laravel.

<h2>Setup</h2>
Local development is granted by Homestead, to bring it up locally, execute 'php vendor/bin/homestead make' after composer update. Aftzer that you can bring up the virtual environment by 'vagrant up'.

<h2>TODO</h2>
<ul>
<li>Database structure</li>
<li>Calculator functionality with Vue.js</li>
<li>Select recipe on click and pass id to calculator page</li>
</ul>
